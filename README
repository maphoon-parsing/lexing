Maphoon is a collection of tools for the construction of compilers that uses C++-17. 
MaphTT (Maphoon Tokenizer Tools) is a library of C++ functions for the creation
of tokenizers in C++. It is intended to be used in combination with the parser generator, but the parser generator is not finished yet.

MaphTT contains two types of automata, called acceptors and classifiers. An acceptor can only accept or reject a word. A classifier 
classifies input by type. A classifier is obtained by pairing acceptors to token types.

MaphTT contains functions that run and use a nondeterministic classifier at once. 
It MaphTT contains functions for the determinization and minimization of classifiers.
It contains functions for generation of efficient, table-based tokenizers, and for the translation of classifiers into C++ code. 
All intermediate steps are transparant, which means that it is easy to see the automata.
